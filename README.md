# vim-config
Some out of the box configurations for vim that I use anywhere I am.

The badwolf colour scheme can be found here: https://github.com/vim-scripts/badwolf
The colour scheme is the only configuration that won't work out of the box unless you have it downloaded into your "colors"
directory, but feel free to remove the line.
